While it's fine to use your laptop, it will be hard for us to diagnose all the different problems that might arise with so many participants. So we recommend using a common computational environment during the workshop. We'll use the Berkeley DataHub for this. You can think of DataHub as providing user-specific virtual machines with identical software for all of us to use.

To access your own machine/server with Python, git, and terminal access on the campus DataHub (also used for various data science, CS, and statistics courses), click [here](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fberkeley-scf%2Fcompute-skills-2024&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fcompute-skills-2024%2F&branch=main).

That will get you onto your server with the materials for the course, from the `berkeley-scf/compute-skills-2024` repository available on the server.

To check things look good:

 1. Click on `Terminal`
 2. Check that your working directory is `~/compute-skills-2024` (by looking at the terminal prompt or running `pwd`)
 3. Run `ls` to see the materials.
