Incoming Statistics graduate students arrive with a wide variety of familiarity/expertise.\nThe department will be holding a (new this year) computational skills workshop the week before classes, focusing on best practices for computation, code development and statistics/data science workflows. All incoming PhD and MA students are expected to attend the workshop, which will be held August 22-23. Those who already have extensive work or other experience with the topics can request to opt out of the workshop via this form (which will be considered by department faculty), as can PhD students who plan to focus exclusively on theory and feel the computing skills/tools covered in the workshop arenâ€™t relevant.\nIn advance, there will also be an optional introduction to Python for those students (particularly those taking Statistics 243) who do not have a basic familiarity with Python, to be held August 20-21. If you are interested, please sign up for the optional introduction.\nSee the syllabus for more details on workshop content.",
